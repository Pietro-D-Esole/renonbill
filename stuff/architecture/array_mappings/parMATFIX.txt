parMATFIX holds cost values of systems. Values always written to (x, 1)th index

heater_count = Number of options under HEATING (plant type) in Heating and DHW sheet (6 for our default data)
emitter_count = Number of options under HEATING (emitter type) in Heating and DHW sheet (6 for our default data)
dhw_count = Number of options under plant type (hot water) in Heating and DHW sheet (2 for our default data)

from parMATFIX(1) to heater_count
they assign cost + installation cost of heating types

parMATFIX(heater_count + 1) = cost + installation cost of pellet stove under HEATING (plant type)
parMATFIX(heater_count + 2) = cost + installation cost of heat pump under HEATING (plant type)

from  parMATFIX(heater_count + 3) to heater_count + emitter_count + 2
they assign cost + installation cost of emitter types

parMATFIX(heater_count + emitter_count + 3) = cost + installation cost of solar heating under HEATING (plant type)
parMATFIX(heater_count + emitter_count + 4) = cost + installation cost of electric boiler under plant type (hot water)

from  parMATFIX(heater_count + 5) to heater_count + emitter_count + dhw_count + 4
they assign cost + installation cost of DHW types

parMATFIX(heater_count + emitter_count + dhw_count + 5) = cost + installation cost of heat pump under plant type (hot water)
parMATFIX(heater_count + emitter_count + dhw_count + 6) = cost + installation cost of solar heater under plant type (hot water)

parMATFIX(heater_count + emitter_count + dhw_count + 7) = cost + installation cost of insulating m2 of wall
parMATFIX(heater_count + emitter_count + dhw_count + 8) = cost + installation cost of insulating m2 of roof
parMATFIX(heater_count + emitter_count + dhw_count + 9) = cost + installation cost of insulating m2 of floor
These 3 values above are calculated using (material cost for 1m2) * ratio of thickness/envelope conductivity + installation cost for 1m2
This means these values are only for 1m2. material cost and installation cost are taken from Envelope & Windows sheet

parMATFIX(heater_count + emitter_count + dhw_count + 10) = Value of single grazed cost, €/m2 (all inclusive) in Envelope & Windows sheet
parMATFIX(heater_count + emitter_count + dhw_count + 11) = Value of double grazed cost, €/m2 (all inclusive) in Envelope & Windows sheet
