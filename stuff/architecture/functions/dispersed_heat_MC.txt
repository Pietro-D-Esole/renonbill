dispersed_heat_MC(irec, curflag, qwin, qsg, qfloor, qroof, qv, qw, qis, qDHW, Area)

irec = index of current record
curflag = flag to define if i am calculating current or planned values 0 for current 1 for planned
qwin = heat transfer thorugh windows
qsg = total solar radiation passing through windows
qfloor = heat transfer through floor
qroof = heat transfer through roof
qv = heat transfer beacuse of air exchange (ventilation)
qw = heat transfer through walls
qis
qDHW = heat transfer on DHW
Area = Floor area of current case

Function starts taking values from readparam function and calculates 
Vol = total volume of building
Snetta = net surface area of one floor
Vnetto = net volume of one floor
Stot = total floor area of whole building

After that they call a function named lateral. This function calculates the area of outer side for a floor. calculation changes according to type of building.
Using the Slat(Surface area of total outer side) they calculate Swin(Total area of windows)
Then since we know total outer area of a floor and windows in it, we calculate Sw(total area of outer walls for a building)
Then they calculate
Area = commercial area of building
Gv = total air that is exchanged. Unit of this is m3 / hour
Gv2 = again total air that is exchanged. But this time they use a fixed value from data file and Vnetto

Then they calculate qv2 and qv. Difference of qv and qv2 is on qv Gv2, on qv2 Gv is used
qis, qwin, qsg, qs and qw calculated seperately
Then program calculates qfloor, qsroof and qroof. qsroof is value about the shadow inside the roof and it is used for calculation of qroof

Now the program calculates H values. They say unit is W/K. closest thing I found on the internet is W/m2K which is "Thermal Permeability Coefficient"
Thermal Permeability Coefficient is value for heat passed from two 1m2 plates when one of plate is 1C hotter which are 1m away from each other
If this value is small, then we lose less heat.

Lastly, program calculates qDHW. They assume 4 people living for 100m2 and each person is using 30kg for a day
