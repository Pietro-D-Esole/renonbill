VAN = NPV in Italian

quickNPV(year, VC_f, VC_e, FIXC, Qvan, Qirr, QPB, NPV)
year = current year that NPV will be calculated
VC_f = Total amount of fuel costs for that year. This variable includes bot heating and DHW
VC_e = Total amount of electric costs for that year. This variable includes bot heating and DHW
FIXC = Total fixed investment needed for case
Qvan = quick VAN (VAN means npv)
Qirr = quick IRR (internal rate of return)
QPB = quick payback. Probably "discounted payback period"
NPV = Net present value

Function starts checking if current year is 0
	If that condition is true, then function assigns FIXC into a variable named fixc0
	Then function checks if we are taking bonus
		If we are taking bonus, function gets its amount and return time
			If return time is not 0, Then we calculate a variable named rata0
	If we are not taking bonus, then both rata0 and bonus are 0

	Next, fucntion checks if we are taking loan
		If we are, then it gets loanyrs, loan amount, loan rate and calculates Rataloan0
	Else loan and Rataloan0 is 0
	We assign 0 to flagpb and flagdpb then 1 to tasso_integrale here.
	Next, we check if returntime is 0, then we assigin same value into van_mc(0), van_MCPB(0) and cashflow(0) according to condition

If year is greater than 0
	If year is greater than return time, we assign 0 to rata, otherwise we assign rata0 to rata
	If year is greater than loanyrs, assign 0 to RATAloan. Otherwise, assign Rataloan0 to RATAloan
	Next, function calculates cashflow(year) and tasso_integrale.(tasso integrale = full ratio, Tasso Sconto = discount rate)
	TassoScontoMC takes the value of parMATDR
	If tasso_integrale is not 0, then function calculates cashflowAtt(year) and van_mc(year)
	Then function calculates van_MCPB(year)
	If van_mc(year) is greater than 0 and van_mc(year-1) is 0 or less
		QFB calculated and flagdpb is changed to 1
	If van_MCPB(year) is greater than 0 and van_MCPB(year-1) is 0 or less, then we change flagpb to 1
	
	If year is vita
		If flagdpb is 0 and van_mc(year) is different than van_mc(year-1)
			QPB is calculated (NOTE: It looks same with the previous one)
		(NOTE: They did nothing if flagpb is 0 so I did not write them)

If year is vita
	van_mc(year) is assgined to Qvan
	IRR function called
	from 0 to vita
		values in van_mc is assigned to NPV(i, 0)
